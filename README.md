# What is Moodflix?

Media that describes media. Moodflix is a website that allows user to create reviews of movies, these reviews however are contruscted via images rather than the traditional written standard. As we can see today most media, entertainment, content, Ads, and etc. are consumed via short clips/images. So why not make reviews the same way? Allow consumers to get a quick digest of what the  movie/flim is all about in a more abstract and distinct manor. This is Moodflix.
